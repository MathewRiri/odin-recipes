        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            10 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia
            salt and ground black pepper to taste
            ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
            1 cup buttermilk
            1 large egg
            ½ cup all-purpose flour
            ½ cup yellow cornmeal
            2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
            ½ teaspoon baking powder
            ½ teaspoon baking soda
            vegetable oil for frying
        </ul>  
        <h3>Steps</h3>  
        <ol>
            Step 1
            Season fillets with salt and pepper. Dust fillets with 1/3 cup flour.

            Step 2
            Beat buttermilk and egg in a bowl until combined. Stir together 1/2 cup flour, cornmeal, seafood seasoning, baking powder, and baking soda in another bowl. Dip flour-dusted fillets into egg mixture, then into seasoned flour mixture.

            Step 3
            Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large frying pan or deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

            Step 4
            Working in batches, fry fillets in hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season immediately with salt after frying.
